I\nmust put in an appearance there,</span>, <span class=\"green\">the prince</span>, <span class=\"red\">My daughter is\ncoming for me to take me there.</span>, <span class=\"red\">I thought today's fete had been canceled. I confess all these\nfestivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.</span>, <span class=\"red\">If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would\nhave been put off,</span>, <span class=\"green\">the prince</span>, <span class=\"red\">Don't tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev's\ndispatch? You know everything.</span>, <span class=\"red\">What can one say about it?</span>, <span class=\"green\">the prince</span>, <span class=\"red\">What has been decided?

Perhaps I don't understand\nthings, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war.\nShe is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious\nsovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is\nthe one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to\nperform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble\nthat God will not forsake him.

We alone must\navenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely\non?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot\nunderstand the Emperor Alexander's loftiness of soul. She has\nrefused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some\nsecret motive in our actions. What answer did Novosiltsev get? None.\nThe English have not understood and cannot understand the\nself-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only\ndesires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! And\nwhat little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has\nalways declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe\nis powerless before him.... And I don't believe a word that Hardenburg\nsays, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just a\ntrap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored\nmonarch.

It can also be defined as a directory number temporarily assigned to a mobile for a mobile terminated call. A MSRN is assigned for every mobile terminated call, not only the calls where the terminating MS lives on a different MSC than the originating MS. Although this seems unnecessary since many vendors' VLR's are integrated with the MSC, the GSM specification indicates that the MSC and VLR (Visitor Location Register) do not need to reside on the same switch. They are considered two different nodes as they have their own routing addresses. The MSRN is one of the returned parameters into SRI_Response message. In particular the MSRN is used into an MNP scenario (in this case it can be modified as 'RgN + MSISDN'\n",

      "Title: The Men Who Want to Live Forever\nURL: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/opinion/sunday/silicon-valley-immortality.html\nWould you like to live forever? Some billionaires, already invincible in every other way, have decided that they also deserve not to die. Today several biotech companies, fueled by Silicon Valley fortunes, are devoted to “life extension” — or as some put it, to solving “the problem of death.”\nIt’s a cause championed by the tech billionaire Peter Thiel, the TED Talk darling Aubrey de Gray, Google’s billion-dollar Calico longevity lab and investment by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. The National Academy of Medicine, an independent group, recently dedicated funding to “end aging forever.”\nAs the longevity entrepreneur Arram Sabeti told The New Yorker: “The proposition that we can live forever is obvious. It doesn’t violate the laws of physics, so we can achieve it.” Of all the slightly creepy aspects to this trend, the strangest is the least noticed: The people publicly championing life extension are mainly men.\nNot all of them, of course. In 2009, Elizabeth Blackburn received the Nobel Prize for her work on telomeres, protein caps on chromosomes that may be a key to understanding aging. Cynthia Kenyon, the vice president for aging research at Calico, studied life extension long before it was cool; her former protégée, Laura Deming, now runs a venture capital fund for the cause. But these women are focused on curbing age-related pathology, a concept about as controversial as cancer research. They do not appear thirsty for the Fountain of Youth.\nProfessor Blackburn’s new book on telomeres couldn’t be clearer. “Does our research show that by maintaining your telomeres you will live into your hundreds?” it says. “No. Everyone’s cells become old and eventually we die.” Ms. Kenyon once described her research’s goal as “to just have a healthy life and then turn out the lights.” Even Ms. Deming, a 23-year-old prodigy who worked in Ms. Kenyon’s lab at age 12, points out that “aging is innately important to us.”\nFew of these experts come close to matching the gaudy statements of the longevity investor and “biohacker” Dave Asprey, who has told journalists, “I decided that I was just not going to die.” Or those of Brian Hanley, a microbiologist who has tested an anti-aging gene therapy he developed on himself, who claimed: “There’s a bunch of things that will need to be done to achieve life spans into at least hundreds of years. But we’ll get there.” Or of the 74-year-old fashion mogul Peter Nygard, who during a promotional clip receives injections of his own stem cells to reverse his aging while declaring: “Ponce de León had the right idea. He was just too early. That was then. This is now.”\nI came across Mr. Nygard’s ode to human endurance three years ago while beginning research on a novel about a woman who can’t die, and watching that video allowed me to experience something close to life extension. As Mr. Nygard compared himself to Leonardo da Vinci and Benjamin Franklin while dancing with a bevy of models — or as a voice-over explained, “living a life most can only dream of” — nine minutes of YouTube expanded into a vapid eternity, where time melted into a vortex of solipsism.\nAt that time I was immersed in caring for my four young children, and this paean to everlasting youth seemed especially stupid. I recall thinking that if this was eternal life, death didn’t seem that bad.\nBut now, as powerful men have begun falling like dominoes under accusations of sexual assault, that video with its young women clustered around an elderly multimillionaire has haunted me anew. As I recall my discomfort with the proclamations of longevity-driven men who hope to achieve “escape velocity,” I think of the astonishing hubris of the Harvey Weinsteins of the world, those who saw young women’s bodies as theirs for the taking.\nMuch has been said about why we allowed such behavior to go unchecked. What has remained unsaid, because it is so obvious, is what would make someone so shameless in the first place: These people believed they were invincible. They saw their own bodies as entirely theirs and other people’s bodies as at their disposal; apparently nothing in their lives led them to believe otherwise.\nHistorically, this is a mistake that few women would make, because until very recently, the physical experience of being a woman entailed exactly the opposite — and not only because women have to hold their keys in self-defense while walking through parking lots at night. It’s only very recently that women have widely participated in public life, but it’s even more recently that men have been welcome, or even expected, to provide physical care for vulnerable people.\nOnly for a nanosecond of human history have men even slightly shared what was once exclusively a woman’s burden: the relentless daily labor of caring for another person’s body, the life-preserving work of cleaning feces and vomit, the constant cycle of cooking and feeding and blanketing and bathing, whether for the young, the ill or the old. For nearly as long as there have been humans, being a female human has meant a daily nonoptional immersion in the fragility of human life and the endless effort required to sustain it.\nObviously not everyone who provides care for others is a saint. But engaging in that daily devotion, or even living with its expectation, has enormous potential to change a person. It forces one to constantly imagine the world from someone else’s point of view: Is he hungry? Maybe she’s tired. Is his back hurting him? What is she trying to say?\nThe most obvious cure for today’s gender inequities is to put more women in power. But if we really hope to create an equal society, we will also need more men to care for the powerless — more women in the boardroom, but also more men at the nurses’ station and the changing table, immersed in daily physical empathy. If that sounds like an evolutionary impossibility, well, it doesn’t violate the laws of physics, so we can achieve it. It is surely worth at least as much investment as defeating death.\nPerhaps it takes the promise of immortality to inspire the self-absorbed to invest in unsexy work like Alzheimer’s research. If so, we may all one day bless the inane death-defiance as a means to a worthy end.\nBut men who hope to live forever might pause on their eternal journey to consider the frightening void at invincibility’s core. Death is the ultimate vulnerability. It is the moment when all of us must confront exactly what so many women have known all too well: You are a body, only a body, and nothing more.\n"

      "Title: Delivering inclusive urban access: 3 uncomfortable truths\nURL: https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development//2018/01/26/delivering-inclusive-urban-access-3-uncomfortable-truths/\nBody:\nThe past few decades have been filled with a deep optimism about the role of cities and suburbs across the world. These engines of economic growth host a majority of world population, are major drivers of economic innovation, and have created pathways to opportunities for untold amounts of people.\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeffrey Gutman\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNonresident Senior Fellow - Global Economy and Development \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdie Tomer\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFellow - Metropolitan Policy Program \n\n Twitter\nAdieTomer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut all is not well within our so-called Urban Century. Rapid urbanization, rising gentrification, concentrated poverty, and shortages of basic infrastructure have combined to create spatial inequity in cities and suburbs across the globe. The challenges of housing, moving, and employing so many people have led to longer travel times, rising housing costs, and unsustainable public spending. Moreover, policymakers are questioning traditional policies and approaches.\nThe past couple years, we’ve led a project at Brookings—Moving to Access—that responds to these spatial challenges by promoting the idea of connecting people to opportunities as a new foundational principle for 21st century urban development. This principle of accessibility is meant to be a corollary to the natural questions we ask ourselves everyday about the communities where we live: Is this the best location to access employment? Are there nearby schools and health services? Is there a market in the neighborhood? How can I get from here to there? Such choices are valid for those with sufficient income. But what about those with more limited resources and thus choices in terms of affordable housing and affordable transport?\nWhile economists, planners, and engineers have promoted accessibility for decades, the concept is more often found in textbooks than formal urban policies. In the first stage of this project, we worked with a team of experts to determine what has stalled practical implementation of appropriate policies and practices? “Delivering Inclusive Access,” a report of this initial work, offers a synthesis of what we found and where we believe researchers, policymakers, and practitioners can take this work next. The paper found three central challenges.\nThe fallacy of the single indicator\nThe current transport regime’s approach to measurement is one of outward elegance: The dominant pursuit is speed, and the primary way to measure it is congestion (or what slows us down). Many have come to label this approach a pursuit of “mobility.” It is seen through different, but often singular, measures of how congestion affects a specific roadway. Such singular measures are easily interpreted by policymakers and civil society and can be translated directly into economic analysis of related investments through timesavings. They also conveniently serve such purposes as the internationally agreed-upon Sustainable Development Goals. Yet they actually don’t answer the fundamental question of who can reach where, in how much time, and at what cost.\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nReport\nDelivering inclusive access\n\nJeffrey Gutman, Adie Tomer, Joseph W. Kane, Nirav Patel, and Ranjitha Shivaram\nAugust 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nReport\nMeasuring performance: Accessibility metrics in metropolitan regions around the world\n\nGeneviève Boisjoly and Ahmed El-Geneidy\nAugust 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nReport\nIs better access key to inclusive cities?\n\nJeffrey Gutman and Nirav Patel\nWednesday, October 5, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility measures can answer those questions, but not through any one measure. First, the variable social, economic, and political contexts related to access mean searching for a single magical indicator is counterintuitive. For example, a wealthy, automobile-centric region like Dallas, Texas, may have very different measurable goals than a denser, poorer region like Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Second, academic literature is now rife with such complex measures that it could be difficult to communicate their methodology and results with practitioners. The development of a suite of indicators could offer a menu for policymakers and practitioners to judge accessibility based on local objectives, local conditions, and local capacity.\nThe danger of excessive localization\nDecentralization and empowering local communities is fast becoming a mantra of governance experts across the world, from development practitioners at institutions like the World Bank to city-focused theorists. And for good reason: delegating policy design and fiscal authority directly to the local level helps ensure policies and practices respond to local needs and desires. Yet as urban areas spillover into contiguous and often numerous municipalities, local independence can introduce certain challenges, especially relating to social and environmental externalities. When it comes to transportation and land development, interests of one municipality are often different from its neighbors. And these divergent development goals can exacerbate accessibility challenges within growing regions, spreading people, housing jobs, and other activities further from one another.\nAddressing spatial inequities in land use and real estate markets require a broader approach to horizontal governance. While there are examples of metropolitan transport authorities, there is less willingness to consider metropolitan or horizontal governance of land use and fiscal policies. For example, should housing be coordinated across an entire region?\nCountries with a more centralized top down approach to governance, such as France and Germany, have greater ability to formulate metropolitan governance than more decentralized countries such as the U.S. This is not to say there is a one-size-fits-all approach, but there is an opportunity to test different solutions within different governance contexts, comparing how effective each model is to promote spatial inclusivity.\nThe finance community is missing in action\nFinancing is a central topic in infrastructure circles. As maintenance bills from the automobile era come due, populations continue to grow, and fiscal budgets are tight, how can urban areas afford to build enough infrastructure to support future economic growth? In response, new approaches are evolving in fiscal instruments, such as value capture and private-public partnerships. Missing in these discussions, however, are the implications for inclusive access.\nWe conducted a multi-decade review of past academic literature on access and found that there is no clear substantive discussion of accessibility from a fiscal perspective. While urban transport and land use professionals clearly recognize their interrelationship in achieving inclusive accessibility, at least in theory, the fiscal and finance professionals generally ignore the implications of their instruments with regard to inclusivity. The multilateral development banks and their economic evaluations have ignored the distributive impacts until very recently. And the efforts of some countries to incorporate measures through multi-criteria analysis have had limited impact.\nThis gap must be resolved in any effort toward inclusive urban development. There is little doubt that fiscal approaches must carefully assess who ultimately pays and that alternative finance instruments should be adapted to foster access for all.\nGoing forward\nOur research confirms that there are enormous opportunities to advance accessibility theory into practice. At this point, what is desperately needed is to launch a range of case studies that deal with these issues and challenges under different geographic, governance, and economic contexts. The good news is that many initiatives are already underway, and more robust communication channels and technology can support such efforts. In Chicago, researchers created an online platform to visually explore accessibility by location. In Bogota, researchers evaluated how affordability is a key principle of access. And in Cairo and Kigali, researchers used open tools to achieve new insights for accessibility. Sharing the results of these case studies could lead to a new level of cross-disciplinary approaches to improve accessibility and lessen the effects of spatial inequity.\n\n"

      "used in some education sectors. For instance, a growing number of colleges use predictive analytics to identify struggling students who need additional assistance, so faculty and administrators can intervene before the student drops out. But frequently there is insufficient attention, once the results of these predictive analyses are in hand, about how to communicate the information in a way that is likely to lead to behavior change among students or educators. And much of the predictive analytics work has been on the side of plugging leaks in the pipeline (e.g. preventing drop-outs from higher education), rather than on the side of proactively sending students and families personalized information about educational and career pathways where they are likely to flourish. \n",

Families like these also have to devote a substantial portion of their cognitive bandwidth to just making ends meet financially.

      "There is understandable excitement about the impact that new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics will have on our economy. In our everyday lives, we already see the benefits of these technologies: when we use our smartphones to navigate from one location to another using the fastest available route or when a predictive typing algorithm helps us finish a sentence in our email. At the same time, there are concerns about possible negative effects of these new technologies on labor. The Council of Economic Advisers of the past two Administrations have addressed these issues in the annual Economic Report of the President (ERP). For example, the 2016 ERP included a chapter on technology and innovation that linked robotics to productivity and growth, and the 2019 ERP included a chapter on artificial intelligence that discussed the uneven effects of technological change. Both these chapters used data at highly aggregated levels, in part because that is the data that is available. As I’ve noted elsewhere, AI and robots are everywhere, except, as it turns out, in the data.\n",

      "To date, there have been no large scale, systematic studies in the U.S. on how robots and AI affect productivity and labor in individual firms or establishments (a firm could own one or more establishments, which for example could be a plant in a manufacturing setting or a storefront in a retail setting). This is because the data are scarce. Academic researchers interested in the effects of AI and robotics on economic outcomes have mostly used aggregate country and industry-level data. Very recently, some have studied these issues at the firm level using data on robot imports to France, Spain, and other countries. I review a few of these academic papers in both categories below, which provide early findings on the nuanced role these new technologies have on labor. Thanks to some excellent work being done by the U.S. Census Bureau, however, we may soon have more data to work with. This includes new questions on robot purchases in the Annual Survey of Manufacturers and Annual Capital Expenditures Survey and new questions on other technologies including cloud computing and machine learning in the Annual Business Survey.\n",
      "While these new data are a promising step, there is still a need for a large-scale survey of technology use across multiple sectors of the economy. Congress should fund the U.S. Census Bureau to collect this data. The work that Census has done so far—for example by collecting data on the purchase and use of robotics in the manufacturing sector, via its Annual Survey of Manufacturing—provides a blueprint for how this can be done across other sectors of the economy. With better data, researchers will be able to measure the effects of these technologies on a range of issues including productivity, employment, training, inequality and regional competitiveness, and policy makers will be able to develop well-informed policy—or tweak, update, or eliminate existing policy.\n",
      "Robots create and destroy jobs in manufacturing\n",
      "Most studies of how robots affect the economy have used data published by the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), a trade association that collects data from its members. For example, Georg Graetz and Guy Michaels used the IFR data for 17 countries for the period 1993 to 2007 to show a positive link between robots and productivity. Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo used IFR data to study the effect of robot exposure on U.S. manufacturing jobs. They found that one robot per thousand manufacturing workers reduces the employment-to-population ratio by about 0.18-0.34 percentage points.\n",

      "More recently, several studies have used data on robot imports to study the effect of robots on employment outcomes at firms. Using data from several French government sources, Acemoglu, Claire Lelarge, and Restrepo found that, in French manufacturing firms, those firms that adopted robots added jobs. This finding, which runs counter to the popular notion that “robots are coming for our jobs,” reflects the same positive relationship between robot adoption and jobs documented by researchers in other countries, including Canada, Denmark, and Spain. In other words, robots may be good for employment, at least at adopting firms in advanced economies. There is one big gap in the literature, however—we don’t yet have the data needed to do a similar study in the U.S.\n",
      "Acemoglu, Lelarge, and Restrepo also found that manufacturing firms are likely to lose jobs when their competitors adopt robots. Moreover, they found that, on net, the negative effects on employment at other firms dominate the positive effects at robot adopting firms: even as some manufacturing firms grow and add jobs (those adopting robots), a larger number of manufacturing firms shrink and lose jobs. This same result has also been found in a study by Koch, Manuylov, and Smolka using data from Spain. Again, due to lack of data, we don’t know if the same effect occurs in the U.S.\n",
      "These and other recent studies make it clear that the relationship between robots and jobs is nuanced, at least in manufacturing settings in advanced economies. There are still a number of outstanding questions about the relationship between robots and jobs, as there are for AI and other new technologies:\n",
      "\n",
      "Why don’t all firms adopt robots if they can, especially since those that don’t adopt robots seem to suffer employment losses? Does the relationship between robots and firm-level employment also hold in the case of other technologies, like AI?\n",
      "What happens to workers who lose their jobs at firms that don’t adopt robots? Do they end up working at other firms that adopt robots? Is the same true for workers at firms that don’t adopt AI?\n",
      "When firms that adopt robots add jobs, what types of workers do they hire, and are they well paid? What about the skills and wages for workers at firms that adopt AI?\n",
      "\n",
      "More high-quality data from government statistical agencies will help researchers address these questions.\n",
      "Recent U.S. Census Bureau measurement efforts\n",
      "In addition to its important work surveying the population every ten years, the U.S. Census Bureau routinely surveys business establishments and firms about a range of issues, including revenues, expenses, wages, and others. The data collected from these surveys help government agencies to estimate GDP, employment, wage growth, trade deficits, and other factors to predict how current macroeconomic conditions and government policies are affecting the economy, workers, and households.\n",
      "The U.S. Census Bureau has started measuring the use of robotics in U.S. establishments and firms through the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) and the Annual Capital Expenditures Survey (ACES). It also measures the use of AI, cloud hosting services, robotics, and other technologies in U.S. firms through the Annual Business Survey (ABS). A recent video conference jointly hosted by New York University and the U.S. Census Bureau highlighted some of the early findings from these surveys and sought feedback for soon-to-be-released experimental data products from experts in the field.\n",
      "In 2018, the ASM, an annual sample survey of approximately 50,000 manufacturing establishments, included three robotics-related questions. The survey asked about capital expenditures on robots, the number of new robots in 2018, and the total stock of robots in 2018. Funding for the cognitive testing of these questions—a necessary step to ensure that respondents understand the questions being asked—was provided by the National Science Foundation. Initial evidence from the survey indicates that manufacturing establishments that adopt robots tend to be larger (as measured by number of employees). Robots are used in most manufacturing industries across many U.S. states, but the states with the largest percent of manufacturing establishments using robots are in the industrial Midwest. Preliminary estimates show robot exposure rates—the share of workers working next to robots—exceed 30 percent in the Transportation Equipment, Primary Metal, and Plastic and Rubber Products industries.\n",
      "The ACES, which surveys approximately 50,000 firms in a variety of industrial sectors about their capital expenditures, included a single question on robotics expenditures in its 2018 survey. The question mirrored the capital expenditure question asked of establishments in the 2018 ASM survey, but at the firm level (a firm can have multiple establishments). This survey similarly found that firms adopting robots tend to be larger (as measured by number of employees). The manufacturing sector had the highest total capital expenditures on robots and highest average by firm. Other industries with high capital expenditures on robots include non-store retailers and hospitals. The ACES is the only survey instrument that delivers data on capital expenditures in the U.S. from a representative sample of firms across all economic sectors.\n",
      "In 2018 the ABS included a number of questions about technologies used at the firm. It asked whether firms use cloud-based services such as servers, data storage, data analysis, and customer relationship management, and business technologies such as machine learning, machine vision, touchscreens, and robotics. The big takeaways from this survey are that digitization has been widely adopted by all firms and sectors; diffusion is highest among the oldest and largest firms; and technology usage increases with size in all age categories. Cloud-based services have been less widely adopted but are used for many different functions. There is high variability in type and use by sector: manufacturing is a leading adopter of certain technologies, such as machine learning, machine vision, and robotics. The ABS also finds ample evidence of complementarities between technologies: advanced technology adoption is highly dependent on the adoption of key infrastructure. More detail about findings from the ABS are available in a recently released NBER publication.\n",
      "It is important for the U.S. government to conduct more systematic data collection on the use of robotics and other new technologies in our economy. At a minimum, government data can be used to replicate the existing robot studies that rely on the IFR data. But the disaggregated firm-level and establishment-level data can also help us understand the conditions under which robots complement or substitute for labor and help policymakers design and evaluate the appropriate policy responses. Moreover, government data could help us understand whether the effects that are emerging in the case of robotics also hold for AI and other technologies.\n",
      "More funding for more measurement \n",
      "While the recent efforts of the U.S. Census Bureau are an important first step, there is more that could be done if the funding were available. In the late 1980s, the Census Bureau conducted the Survey of Manufacturing Technology (SMT). The purpose of the SMT was to measure the presence, use, and planned use of advanced technologies in the manufacturing sector. The Survey was administered in years 1988, 1991 and 1993 but was discontinued for funding reasons. Congress should provide funding to Census to conduct a modern, standalone version of the SMT. Ideally this new survey would be a short, annual, standalone survey of technology use at the establishment level across multiple industries in the economy. The survey would include questions about the use of specific technologies, such as robots, machine learning, cloud, e-commerce, autonomous guided vehicles, and others, and could be a simple “yes/no” question about whether the establishment has the technology or not. Questions about new technologies could be added in the future. It is important for the survey to be annual, so that changes in technology use could be tracked over time. An establishment level survey would allow for a granular analysis of adoption of a specific technology at that establishment on workers at that same establishment. In contrast, data that comes from firm level surveys make it harder to establish a causal link between adoption of a technology and effects on workers because firm level surveys aggregate information from all the establishments owned by the firm. In addition, since establishments are linked to a specific geography, an establishment level survey would allow for an analysis of how new technologies affect employment, inequality and other outcomes in different localities. The data could also be used to benchmark U.S. technological adoption relative to other countries.\n",
      "Ideally, Congress would realize the value of such a survey and fund the Census Bureau to create it. The biggest challenge for such a survey is cost. There are two types of costs: the upfront costs of creating a new survey, which would primarily be the cost of conducting cognitive testing of the survey questions, and the recurring costs of administering the survey annually. These costs are hard to estimate and depend on the number of questions asked and number of establishments surveyed. The Census Bureau’s prior experience working with external researchers on the Management and Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS), which involved the creation of a standalone survey, may provide a useful benchmark on costs. The costs of developing and administering the MOPS survey was partially defrayed by use of grant funds from the National Science Foundation (NSF) from external researchers. This was also the case with the development of the robotics questions for the ASM, which benefited from a NSF grant. A similar model could be used to help defray some of the costs of a standalone technology survey.\n",
      "There would be a variety of factors for the Census Bureau to consider when designing a new survey. The Census Bureau’s experience developing questions on the establishment level purchase and use of robots for the ASM should be useful. The cognitive testing of those questions, which is documented in Buffington, Miranda, and Seamans (2018), involved in-person interviews with plant managers to assess their understanding of the question and their ability to access the data necessary to accurately answer the questions about number of robots and capital expenditure on robots. The Census Bureau would need to do similar cognitive testing of all the questions in any new standalone survey. On one hand, the testing would be more involved than what was done for robot questions in the ASM as it would involve assessing the ability of managers across multiple sectors of the economy to answer the questions. On the other hand, the testing may be easier as it would involve a single question for each technology—either the establishment has it or not—rather than requiring an estimate of capital expenditures on those technologies, as was done in the ASM.\n",
      "There would be multiple benefits to a standalone survey of technology. The survey would allow researchers to identify sectors and regions of the economy that are being impacted by new technologies. When linked with other data sets, researchers would be able to assess the effects of these technologies on workers and firm level outcomes such as productivity, growth, or firm exit. For example, the data could be linked with establishment-level data from the Annual Survey of Manufacturers to study the effect of these technologies on establishment productivity. Or the data could be linked to firm level occupational data—such as the micro-data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Employment Survey, which is confidential but available to BLS-approved researchers—to identify effects of technologies on workers by occupation. An additional benefit of such a survey is that it may help the BLS improve measurement of multifactor productivity—a measure of how efficiently our economy transforms inputs, including labor, capital, technologies and know-how, into outputs. Accurate productivity statistics help the government assess the overall well-being of the economy and decide when fiscal or monetary policy action needs to be taken to address slowing growth. Some have argued that multifactor productivity suffers from mismeasurement, which may stem in part from not being able to account for the role of new technologies. See Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016) for a useful review of the potential role of mismeasurement.\n",
      "In summary, while there is excitement about the impact that new technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics will have on our economy, we need to do more to measure where and how these technologies are being used. A good place to start would be additional funding from Congress to the U.S. Census Bureau to conduct an annual standalone survey of technology use across establishments in the U.S. economy—in short, it’s time for a Robot Census.\n",
